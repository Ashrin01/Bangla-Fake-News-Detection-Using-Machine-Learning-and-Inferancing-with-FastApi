# Bangla Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning and Inferancing with FastApi
This project aims to create a simple api that will use output from a machine learning model to predict if a news is real or fake. 

## Data Source
The data used in this project was from the paper BanFakeNews: A Dataset for Detecting Fake News in Bangla (Hossain et al., LREC 2020) published In Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 2862â€“2871, Marseille, France. European Language Resources Association.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
First downsample technique was used to balance the dataset. Then NLTK and BNLTK tookit was used to clean and preprocess the data. 

## Machine Learning Models
Different machine learning model was used and evaluted based on their accuracy matrics

| Model | % Accuracy | 
|---|---|
| Naive Bayes | 89.42% |
| SVM | 91.82% |
| XGBoost | 94.80% |
| AdaBoost | 85.96% |
| Decision Tree | 87.98% |
| Random Forest | 95.28% |
| SGD | 92.40% |
| KNN | 82.78% |
| Logistics Regression | 90.19% |
